  <strong>SUMMARY:</strong>
  Order in the Court is a story-building improv game where players
  assume the roles of various characters in a court case and argue to
  reveal the truth using witnesses, evidence, and wit. The rules are
  fairly loose, please feel free to play however your group would like
  to!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>GAME START:</strong>
  The Judge starts the game once the Plaintiff, the Defendant, and all
  the Witnesses have joined. The Judge then decides how to begin the
  game. Typically, this is done by the Judge introducing all the
  players and their roles, along with the issue, then allowing opening
  statements from the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>GAME END:</strong>
  Once all the evidence has been revealed, the Judge ends the game by
  making a verdict. Usually, the Plaintiff and Defendant make closing
  statements before the Judge makes a verdict. The Judge also might
  consult the Jury players.
