    <strong>Players:</strong>

  </p>
  <p>
    Order in the Court is a story-building improv game where players assume the
    roles of various people in a court case and argue to reveal the truth using
    witnesses, evidence, and wit. The rules are fairly loose and can be changed
    depending on how your group would like to play.

  <h2>Roles</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>THE JUDGE:</strong>
    The judge calls the shots. It is up to the judge to decide what questions to
    ask, who gets to talk, who is successful at making their case, and when to
    introduce witnesses. They can decide whether they'd like to keep score based
    on evidence / witness impressions or whether they'd rather leave the scoring
    more loose and pick a winner at the end. If there is a jury present, the
    judge should consult them at the end of the case before making a verdict.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>THE PLAINTIFF / THE DEFENDANT:</strong>
    The plaintiff has filed a law suit against the defendant over a certain
    ISSUE. Both sides will make their case in a handful of ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>EVIDENCE:</strong>
      Each side (P & D) has some amount of evidence. They can use this evidence
      to prove their case - if they can find ways to connect their evidence to
      their argument.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>WITNESSES:</strong>
      You may ask the witnesses questions to help defend your argument. For more
      information, see the Witness Role explanation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>WIT:</strong>
      When the floor is yours to speak, you can make your case however you want!
      It is best to stick to evidence and witnesses, but any other points are
      also worth making (especially puns).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>WITNESSES:</strong>
    In a game of at least 4 people, witnesses may be brought into court.
    Witnesses can stay neutral or pick a side, but must find a way to connect
    their identity to the case at hand, offering some sort of insight. The judge
    picks when to call witnesses. When a witness is called, any witness players
    pick a witness to reveal. The judge and the two sides (P & D) can ask the
    witness questions, and the judge decides what to believe.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>JURY:</strong>
    Spectators may join the jury. Here they will have a view of any revealed
    evidence and witnesses. They have no specific role til the end, when the
    judge will ask them their opinion on the case.
